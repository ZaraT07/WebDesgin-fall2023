        <div class="grid-item main1">My name is Zara Tareen and I have been going
             to EPS since 5th grade. I am a current 9th grader who is in her first trimester
              of high school and taking WEB design. I was really nervous to take web design because 
              I thought I wouldnt understand the concepts at all but it is actually fairly simple! </div>
        <div class="grid-item main2">My favorite thing to do in my free time is, play volleyball, hand out
             with my friends, and go on outdoor adventures with my family!!</div>
        <div class="grid-item sidenav">My favorite class at EPS in my 4 years here has definitely been EP7 
            because we basically got to go swimming for like 7 class periods!</div>
        <div class="grid-item main3">If you were to sign up for a class at EPS in high school WEB design would 
            be one of my top choices! I think its a basic skill everyone should know!</div>
