            Bai tong is a Thai Cafe that has many different options and actually carries
             a lot of different vegan options too! My personal favorite dishes are the panang 
             curry, pad thai, and pad ke mao! They have multiple locations but the redmond 
             location has an absolute beautiful ambience and you can see that on the gallery page!

            Lopez Island Ice Creamery is a washington local ice cream that I absolutely love.
             They often take local fruits and local seattle foods and make them into cool kinds 
             of ice creams. My personal favorite is the Skagit strawberry, but my mom loves the 
             mint a lot. My whole family always gets it when we are in anacortes but you can also
              find it in some local grocery stores like metropolitan market!

           Ellenos yogurt is one of the first local brands my mom and I ever tried at pike place market.
           Pike Place market has a lot of great local shops but Ellenos has to be my favorite. The best 
           flvours are the marrionberry and the lemon curd becayse they seem as though they couldnt be
           good flavours in a yougurt but it actually is the best yogurt I have ever tasted.
