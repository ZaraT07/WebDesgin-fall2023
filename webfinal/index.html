        <div class="grid-item main1">
            <p>The Seattle Metaphysical Library (legally known as the <strong>AS-YOU-LIKE-IT </strong>Library) was established in Seattle in 1961. We have grown over the past 
            six decades to hold over 13,000 books plus thousands of audio and video tapes, CDs, DVDs, magazines and newspaper clippings on a variety of esoteric and controversial topics - material 
            designed to help remove the Veil of Maya - the veil of illusion - from our eyes and help us grow into the fully-realized humans that is our natural birthright.</p>

            <p>We are an all-volunteer, independent resource center providing esoteric and alternative material and events to support personal growth to enhance our understanding of ourselves, the universe and our place in it.
            We are open to the respectful public. There is no charge for browsing the materials or reading at our location. Operating expenses are paid for by our subscribers, who are able to borrow material and by the Raynier 
            Foundation. Find out more about becoming a supporter here.</p>
            
            <p style="color:rgb(126, 19, 153)">Our events are limited now to occasional Zoom classes, Zoom meetings and off-site events - see a listing on the right, and details on our Events page.</p>
        <hr>
        <h5>Community</h5>
        <p>Please feel free to send an email to staff@seattlemetaphysicallibrary.org if you would like to post something on the website, or send out a message in the newsletter.

            One of the benefits of our Library is an opportunity to interact with other people who share your interests. One way of allowing that exchange to continue is to reactivate 
            the blog, and post contributions in the newsletter.</p>
            <br>
            
            <p>Supporters Meeting
            We will continue to have our Supporters meetings once a month, as a Zoom meeting. If you are interested in being part of the support team that keeps the Library running, and would
             like to participate in the Zoom meeting, email staff@seattlemetaphysicallibrary.org for the Zoom invitation.</p>
            <br>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <h5>Volunteers</h5>  
           <p> We are always interested in reliable volunteers who care about the Library. Meet other people with the same esoteric interests that you have.  The Library has over 16,000 books, 
            and they need to stay organized by category - volunteering is a great way to see what the Library has to offer. We also need help with publicity, fundraising, helping members and visitors, 
            leading discussion groups and events. E-mail us or stop by if interested.</p>
            <hr>
