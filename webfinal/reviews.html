                         This work is part one in a series called the Govian Chronicles. In the introduction the author describes his personal system of 
                         spiritual evolution through nine archetypes: the vanguard (1), the empath (2), the innovator (3), the messenger (4), the conjurer 
                         (5), the adept (6), the sage (7), the monarch (8), and the shepherd (9). Robert Blackthorne has created his own personal mythos, 
                         his heroï¿½s journey, through these archetypes or stages of soul development. This development, it is argued, reaches across 
                         lifetimes, dimensions and other worlds. Blackthorne contends that this system for consciousness development was encoded in him 
                         from another lifetime and this book is the first part of the message he discovered. </td>

                        experiments showing the existence of what he calls an "exclusion zone" which forms in water when it interfaces with air or other substances. 
                        This amounts to a fourth phase of water, in addition to liquid, solid and gas. He theorizes that the cause of this effect is similar to 
                        crystallization in a solid material.</td>

                        The standard model sees gravitation and the associated nuclear reactions as the sole forces responsible for the development and structure
                         of the universe. The electric universe, as the name implies, allows a much larger role for electrical forces. This is important because 
                         electric fields, and their associated magnetic fields, are strong enough for a given mass and distance to account for what astronomers
                          are seeing. By contrast, the weakness of gravity over galactic distances requires the existence of "dark matter" and other invisible 
                          entities to fit the observational data.</td>

                         on the abstractions of abstractionists, and misses the core problem of class division.<br>
                        Without a class analysis of the corporate world, the conundrums he posits do not make sense. He talks about the dysfunctional
                         attitudes that a certain segment of our society has toward hands-on work. It is an attitude that tends to degrade the skills
                          of manipulating the material world. I cannot resist pointing out that there are a large number of people who do not share 
                          his disdain for skilled mechanics, but to make my point, the author does not seem to be aware that those people exist - 
                          they are not the part of society that matters to him, therefore, they can be ignored.</td>

                         topics range from political and economic conspiracy theories to physics to space and extraterrestrials (ETs), to the nature of 
                         reality. An ambitious scope, but David Icke is an ambitious man. One gets the feeling that if Icke hadn't a deadline he'd have 
                         turned Human Race into an encyclopedia! Indeed, finding a topic on which he doesn't have an opinion becomes difficult as the reader
                          journeys down "through the Rabbit Hole", to borrow a trademark phrase from his lectures.
