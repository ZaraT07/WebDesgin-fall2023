            <h4>Meeting Wonderful People and Friends!</h4>
            <p>One of the best things about the Metaphysical Library is the opportunity to meet other people 
                with the same esoteric interests that you have. The Library has over <strong>11,000 books</strong>, roughly 
                organized by category. It is a huge job to get them organized within category. Volunteering 
                to help with the shelving is a nice way to see what the Library has to offer.<br><br>

                In addition to books, the library has an extensive, uncataloged collection of audio tapes, video tapes, 
                magazines, CDs, self-published polemics and zines, as well as many file folders of newspaper clippings 
                spanning a 40-year history. This material has never been cataloged, and that is one of the things we
                would like to focus on in the new library.</p>

            <h4>Help Us Promote!</h4>
            <p>Please download, print and post Flyers about our upcoming events. Post them in coffee shops, bulletin boards
                - anywhere posting about local events is allowed. This is a great way you can support the Library -
                by helping get the word out about us and our Events. Check back soon for a new Flyer to distribute.</p>

            <h4>Publicity</h4>
            <p>We can always use help with graphic design and publicity. If you have a flair or interest in helping us make 
                flyers and get the word out, please contact us by e-mail or at (206) 329-1794.</p>

            <h4>Subject-Matter Experts</h4>
            <p>If you are an expert in one of the areas we cover, and are interested in helping shape the collection, we welcome 
                your input.  We can use help in cataloging the material, as well as in building the collection.</p>
            
            <hr>
            <h4>Carpentry</h4>
            <p>We could use some help with carpentry.  We have high ceilings, and our bookcases do not go up to the ceiling.  Weâ€™d 
                like to build some wooden bases upon which to stand our bookcases, and then make sure the bookcases are tightly 
                affixed to the wall.<br>
 
                Also, our fluorescent lighting could use some improvements.</p>
